# The goal of this project is to understand how well Tokenization is suited for AD tasks. Specifically LAD. 
#The idea is to create a reliable unsupervised method

The project still has not hit v1.0 yet.

This is supposed to be my senior year capstone project. I have shamelessly stolen code from a bunch of places and since the project isn't finished yet, I haven't updated the sources just yet.

## The current status of the project
The project just got its first release. To use it is simple

python3 .\WinPyULAD.py -i sample.txt

## The next steps for the project

The next steps for the project include creating a very basic test dataset, along with using more algorithms for testing their accuracy.
