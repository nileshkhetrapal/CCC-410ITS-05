# CCC-410ITS-05
# The goal of this project is to understand the usefulness of Tokenization in AD tasks (Log AD specially)

The project still has not hit v1.0 yet.

This is supposed to be my senior year capstone project. I have shamelessly stolen code from a bunch of places and since the project isn't finished yet, I haven't updated the sources just yet.

## The current status of the project

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sOdyrpqqUMBRy3UQG0PJxE6KZcSWDe-z#scrollTo=9QKBkxrdJ-Lp)

This is the colab notebook with a running version of the AD function. It uses tokenization from Keras and the ECOD model from pyOD. It is a lossy algorithm as it ends up using some data for training but it is still worthwile.

## The next steps for the project

The next steps for the project include creating a very basic test dataset, along with using more algorithms for testing their accuracy.
