User friendly open source forensics toolkit with some NLP

- [ ] Basically creating one simple tool to pass FOR350. This is supposed to update all the older tools developed by Zimmerman with a more accessible UI.
  
- [ ] In the fight against the bad actors, bad UI design holds back a lot of training potential. Especially for people with Eyesight problems. Better looking tools allow us to train good guys faster.
  
- [ ] Use some NLP to allow automatic report generation.... Ok im downplaying this alot.
  
- [ ] This would make the second part of the project largely data science to create a repository for matching all text to artifacts.
  
- [ ] I have been using my Python classes to teach myself Tensorflow so I could use ML for my final project.

- [ ] This would allow me to utilise all the knowledge I’ve gained over this course. 

Issues with this project:
UI design would require latest UI tools. Unfortunately all of them are written in some form of JavaScript. I would have to learn typescript or a framework incredibly quickly. Fortunately for me, I’ve become somewhat of an expert with AI assisted code writing. I can really spread my skills wide enough to work with a language that I am not an expert in, but I only have to use it for my front end so I should be somewhat fine.

Proposed workflow:
1. Getting a Figma design ready
2. Translating that to whatever JS script framework with template for a file explorer
3. Writing that into whatever local browser framework
4. Writing the Python back end
5. Writing a Parser for scanning for information to be presented in the front end.
6. Writing the code to actually run all of Zimmermans tools.
7. Creating a database to store all of the artefacts
8. Creating a basket database to generate the report from
9. Using magic to conjure an AI to spit a readable Report.
